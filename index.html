    <h2>Why I want to build creator</h2>
    <a href = "https://www.literatureandlatte.com/" target = "_blank" style = "div-align:right;">
      This is what I am trying to improve upon </a>
    <p style = "text-align:right;" >It is a writing application called Scrivener, but I think I can make a better one</p>
    <p style = "background-color:#3B1399; border: 1px solid Tomato; color:lightcyan; font-size:18px; font-family:courier; text-align:right;">I love that I can use Replit on my phone. I am typing this piece of code from my phone now. I am using this line to test out the styling of html</p>
    <p>Here is a quote from literature and latte:</p>
  <blockquote>
    We love writing. That's why we're here. Literature & Latte was born out of a desire for tools that embrace the creativity of all forms of composition. We make software we love to useâ€”Scrivener, hugely popular among authors of all stripes, and Scapple, crafted for freeform note-taking.
  </blockquote>
  <p>I believe that I can serve the needs to fiction writers much better with my version of creator</p>
    <p>My goals are to create an andoid app and an ios app for this application in contrast to scrivener which only has the ios app</p>
    <p>
      I want to integrate a better internet browser into the application such as the one I am using in replit
    </p>
    <p>
      And just clear up the ui in general, as the scrivener ai is ok but imperfect, it is too much inspired by Microsoft Word rather creating its own UI. In particular I think it needs to get rid of more stuff, eliminate and ebrace minimalism.
    </p>
    <p>But also I want to integrate this application with both Dall-e-2 and GPT-3/GPT-4.</p>
    <p>I want to create a separate screen for DALL-E-2 so that writers can use it's imagery for inspiration.</p>
    <p>I also want to integrate GPT which has the obvious benefits of helping writers wrtie.</p>
    <p>The primary focus throughout, wil be on augmenting the writer and inspiring the writer rather than using the AI to replace the writer.</p>
    <p>I believe that Chat GPT and other such innovations in AI are only useful as augmenting human creavity rather than replcaing it entirely, and they won't be able to replace humans for some time to come.</p>

    <p>Just going to try out different fonts now and see which I should choose, probably all I need is 3 fonts for everything</p>
    <p style = "font-family:helvetica;"> This font is Helvetica </p>
    <p style = "font-family:roboto;"> This font is Roboto </p>
    <p style = "font-family:futura;"> This font is Futura </p>
